This screencast is a very cursory introduction to a variant of TDD that's described as
everything from "London style" to "Mockist", "Outside-in", "Isolation", and "GOOS".
I've recently started calling it "Discovery Testing" to emphasize its intended benefit
and distance it from the now too-conflated-to-be-useful term "unit test".

The screencast may provide you with a clearer picture about what some people who talk about
mock objects as a *good thing* really mean, by illustrating and demonstrating their
very narrow, but well-defined purpose. This use of mock objects is fundamentally
different than how they're used by other practitioners of TDD, but both tribes
tend to confuse the community by using the same language to describe
differently-motivated activities.
