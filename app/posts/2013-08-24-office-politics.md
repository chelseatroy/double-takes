I did a presentation about how developers can start to dip their toes in the water of effecting change in their teams and organizations based on my experiences as a consultant navigating highly-charged political environments.

In addition to the [above youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amFtMIRBtZs) of the talk as I presented it at [Kalamazoo X](http://kalamazoox.org), here's a copy of the slides as I presented it today at [Madison Ruby](http://madisonruby.org):
