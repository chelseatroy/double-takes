As a software development agency, prospective clients will often ask for an estimate of how much time & money the custom software they want will cost.

Inside the software world, this debate is settled: estimates suck. In a group, this terse declaration is used as a sort of tribal banner to identify other developers of the same ilk. 

I worry, however, that the community spends so much time reveling  in estimate-bashing, that we've collectively *gotten worse at* explaining the trouble with estimates to software outsiders.

### Can you estimate this for me?

Here are a few responses to the question, "can you estimate this for me?" that are unlikely to close the deal:

* "We don't do estimates, we do &lt;Describe Other Activities&gt;", even it's unlikely to be clear how other activities are an adequate substitution for an estimate
* "Estimates put too much pressure on our developers", as if clients are adversaries to protect oneself from
* "Sorry, but people who ask for estimates simply aren't a good fit for &lt;Insert Agency Name&gt;", disregarding the fact that most people have no idea why competent developers might refuse to give estimates

Responses like these are more likely to come off as pretentious than persuasive. 

Some studio runners take pride in turning away anyone who so much as use the "e"-word. Other firms jump at the chance to win any work, and eagerly provide (and contractually commit to!) detailed estimates. Worst of all, some of the biggest players in the industry habitually lowball their estimates up front, with the intention of later employing their well-staffed legal departments to ensnare clients in a supremely profitable death by a thousand change requests.

The more responsible approach, it seems to me, is to make a best effort to educate prospective clients on the reasons behind our community's collective hatred for estimation. After all, the realization that specifying a complete system up-front actually *adds* to a project's risk is counter-intuitive.

### Have some empathy.

Imagine yourself in the shoes of someone hoping to pay others to write an application on their behalf. They are embarking on an expensive venture to buy something intangible, made out of incomprehensible code, and from people who have them at a tremendous informational disadvantage. That's a lot of unknowns! 

If I were swimming in a sea of variables, I'd try to fix as many constants as I possibly could. If I could convert the intangible aspects of purchasing software services into something tangible, then I would have greater control over the project's success. 

Because the vast majority of things people buy in their lifetime are physical goods, it's hard to fault someone for trying to buy software services in the same way they'd go about remodeling their kitchen: design it up front, shop the plan around to some number of contractors, and pick the best proposal from a few quotes. This approach makes sense with physical creation, because:

* Changing the design partway through will require rework and increase overall expense, so one can only benefit from having a complete and detailed plan
* Pitting contractors against one another to propose a price and schedule will externalize the buyer's own expertise deficit, because the contractors will be under competitive pressure to minimize their price
* Contractors participate in a local, reputation-sensitive economy and will be incentivized to swallow any losses in the event that cost overruns exceed their quoted price (in the absence of changes requested by the client)

Any experienced developer will recognize that literally none of these conditions are true when buying software development services.

It's entirely reasonable for someone to naïvely start a conversation with a software studio under the presumption (or hope) that paying someone to write software will compare to paying someone to remodel a kitchen. Consequently, it's our responsibility as professionals to do our best to articulate the dangers inherent in that assumption.

### Articulating the dangers inherent in that assumption.

Earlier, I mentioned that specifying a complete system up front actually adds to the project's risk of failure. That risk is separate from but compounded by seeking fixed price quotes from  software developers. 

One reason developers bristle at complete system specifications is because they tends to solidify the whole team's opinion of what "done" should look like too firmly. From an outsider's perspective, the intangibility of software seems scary, but it can also be a tremendous asset. If the team starts by building something very small, the highly-variable nature of software allows them to incrementally build in whichever direction seems best, allowing the eventual design of the system emerge organically over time. While such an approach might have one's kitchen remodel encroaching upon the bathroom, it will ensure a software system never does more than it absolutely needs to do.

After all, why commit oneself to the fine-grained details at the beginning of a project, when everyone is least-equipped to make an informed decision? While nailing down the details in advance might appear comforting from a risk management perspective, it has the deleterious side effect of dramatically diminishing the team's empowerment to make future decisions that deviate from that initial plan. Future decisions are typically better-informed than today's decisions, because they carry with them the benefit of the team's concrete experience building the software and garnering tangible feedback from stakeholders based on their ongoing interactions with the growing application.

Moreover, when developers commit to an up-front estimate, it unnecessarily creates an adversarial relationship between the present-tense team who is best informed about the software versus the past-tense buyer initially promised a fixed cost, fixed-scope quantity. Negotiating over the financial impact of these inevitable deviations does not contribute to the success of the project, but does run the risk of destroying otherwise healthy working relationships.

### Constraint-conscious development.

For these reasons, a more sound strategy is to distill the initial expectations of the hypothetical application into a list of its desired outcomes. The team can then identify the simplest human and system activities that those outcomes will require. The goal of this activity is to set the bar for initial success so low that everyone involved can easily visualize stepping over it.

To keep the design simple while it remains in this abstract state, the entire team must be on-guard against specifying any detail unnecessarily. Of course, acknowledge secondary decision points as they come up, but defer them until the substantial progress has been made on a concrete implementation of the simple, core design.

What if the prospective client and the developer arrive at a sufficiently simple approach to begin work with one another confidently?

As it happens, great developers employ a number of proven practices for building trust by reducing uncertainty and risk. They might:

* Work in the open. Deploy and demo working code frequently while keeping everything in a stable state. Should an unforeseen event prematurely end the project, the incomplete system should be independently valuable (or at least be in a salvageable state)
* Minimize commitments. At the end of each week, give the client the opportunity to cut their losses and end the engagement if the team isn't showing progress commensurate with their rates
* Find a common language. Run a 1-2 day paid "inception project" to break down the most important aspect of the application into an initial backlog of sufficiently small, technically viable units of work—all the while educating the client about their role as a product owner
* Aggressively tackle clear risks. Sometimes, a poorly understood aspect of the system that won't be needed for weeks carries with it a valid risk of blowing the project's budget out of the water. To avoid that outcome, pull forward focused research activities ("spikes") to eliminate these unknowns toward the beginning of the project, before sunk costs can become too great

The goal of this approach is to put the client in the position to make decisions at the moment they'll be best-informed to make them: as late as possible. 

### Be thoughtful.

For developers, it's easy to scare off perfectly legitimate customers by shouting "we don't do estimates!" It's a little more difficult to realize that doing so has the side effect of limiting one's list of potential clients to those who already understand why up-front specification and estimates are so problematic. That's a relatively small market.

For prospective buyers, some will continue to insist—even after hearing all this out—on contracting at a fixed price for a fixed scope of work. After all, plenty of software consultancies are happy to contract under those terms. Sadly, what such a buyer is unlikely to realize is that they're self-selecting for less-talented—even potentially predatory—vendors. Agencies of highly-skilled developers are typically unwilling to contract on that basis because they understand that it leads to significantly worse outcomes for all parties involved. (To say nothing of the fact that premium agencies are in high enough demand to avoid signing such contracts.)

My hope is that we as developers will continue to hone our pitch about the dangers of up-front specification & estimation, while acknowledging that it's entirely reasonable for folks outside the software realm to initially request them.
